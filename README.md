# NYPL Patron Eligibility Service

This package is intended to be used as a Lambda-based Node.js service.

## Purpose

This app serves `GET /api/v0.1/patrons/:patronid/hold-request-eligibility`. The endpoint assesses whether or not the patron identified by `patronid` is eligible to place holds on research items. The response resembles:

```
{ "eligibility": true|false }
```

The following conditions make one *ineligible*:

 - ptype bars holds (e.g. ptype 120)
 - fines exceed $15
 - patron record has blocks
 - patron has expired card
 - some other condition causes checkouts to fail (e.g. patron has maximum checkouts)

If none of the above conditions are met, the patron will be considered *eligible*.

## Installation

```
